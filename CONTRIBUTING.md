## Using the issue tracker

The [issue tracker](https://github.com/PalomaMobile/android-db-migration/issues) is
the preferred channel for [bug reports](#bug-reports), [features requests](#feature-requests)
and [submitting pull requests](#pull-requests).


## Issues and labels

Our bug tracker utilizes several labels to help organize and identify issues. Here's what they represent and how we use them:

- `bug`
- `duplicate`
- `enhancement`
- `help wanted`
- `invalid`
- `question`
- `wontfix`

For a complete look at our labels, see the [project labels page](https://github.com/PalomaMobile/android-db-migration/labels).


## Bug reports

A bug is a _demonstrable problem_ that is caused by the code in the repository.

Please try to be as detailed as possible in your report. What is
your environment? What steps will reproduce the issue? What
would you expect to be the outcome? All these details will help people to fix
any potential bugs.


## Feature requests

Feature requests are welcome. But take a moment to find out whether your idea
fits with the scope and aims of the project. Please
provide as much detail and context as possible.


## Pull requests

Good pull requests—patches, improvements, new features—are a fantastic
help. They should remain focused in scope and avoid containing unrelated
commits.

If you would like to contribute code to dbMigrationLib you can do so through GitHub by
forking the repository and sending a pull request.

When submitting code, please make every effort to follow existing conventions and style
in order to keep the code as readable as possible. Please also make sure your code compiles.

Before your code can be accepted into the project you must also sign the
[Individual Contributor License Agreement (CLA)][1].
